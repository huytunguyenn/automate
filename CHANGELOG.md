# Changelog

## 1.2.2 - 2026-05-25

- Updated bundled `kobiton` CLI binary in `run-interactive-test` skill to the latest version
- Expanded `run-interactive-test` adb-shell documentation for AI agents: quoting rules (local vs device shell parsing), platform guard (Android only), 22-row intent-to-command cookbook, big-output redirect pattern (to avoid 25k-token MCP overflow), long-running command guidance, and response parsing gotchas in `references/response-shapes.md` — notably that `adb` returns exit code 0 even when the inner command fails


## 1.2.1 - 2026-05-20

- `run-automation-suite` skill now defaults to the **device-only view URL** (`?view=device-only`) when surfacing the live session link, hiding the surrounding Kobiton UI for a cleaner watch-the-test experience. Falls back to the default-view URL only when the user explicitly asks to interact with the device.
- Portal URL mapping in the skill is now derivation-based (`api*.kobiton.com` → `portal*.kobiton.com`) instead of a hard-coded per-env table.


## 1.2.0 - 2026-05-18

- Multi-CLI support: install on GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI in addition to Claude Code
- New `run-interactive-test` skill — natural-language WebDriver/device/file commands powered by the bundled `kobiton` CLI wrapper (macOS Apple Silicon binary included)
- New `/automate:setup` command — bootstraps `~/.kobiton/.credentials` from the authenticated MCP session, no manual file editing
- New `/automate:doctor` command — read-only health checks for CLI install, credentials file, active profile, and required fields
- New `getCredential` MCP tool — backs `/automate:setup`; returns the OAuth user's username, API key (existing or freshly generated), and portal URL
- Session attribution: Appium sessions started via `run-automation-suite` now emit `kobiton:aiToolName`; MCP requests from Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI carry `X-AI-Tool-Name` (set to the originating tool) for adoption analytics (KOB-52724)
- Governance: CodeQL weekly scans + per-PR analysis, security issue routing template


## 1.1.0 - 2026-05-10

- Plugin now sends an `X-AI-Tool-Name: Claude` header on every MCP request so Kobiton can attribute sessions to Claude Code in adoption analytics. Set automatically in all three shipped configs (OAuth, API-key, dev-local) — no end-user action required (KOB-52724)


## 1.0.2 - 2026-04-02

- Improved the accuracy of fetching Appium capabilities supported by Kobiton
- Implemented a reliable method for correlating active sessions with their corresponding device IDs


## 1.0.1 - 2026-04-01

- Added a user confirmation prompt when selecting an app version for testing
- Enabled Claude to open active test sessions for live screen previews


## 1.0.0 - 2026-03-31

- Initial release with 12 MCP tools and 1 skill
- Authentication: OAuth 2.1 with automatic browser login (primary), API key auth for CI/headless (alternative)
- Device management: list, status, reserve, terminate reservation
- Session management: list, details, artifacts, terminate
- App management: list, details, upload to store, confirm to upload
- Skills: run-automation-suite to parse capabilities from local Appium scripts and execute them directly (supports Node.js, Python, .NET, Java)
